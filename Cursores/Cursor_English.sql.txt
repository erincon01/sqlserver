Key Points:

    Cursor Declaration: The DECLARE cPersonCreditCard CURSOR FOR section defines the cursor to iterate through rows from the Sales.PersonCreditCard table.
    Cursor Operations: The OPEN, FETCH NEXT, CLOSE, and DEALLOCATE commands manage the lifecycle of the cursor, fetching and processing rows as needed.
    Nested Cursor: The nested cursor cCreditCard is used to fetch related card details based on CreditCardID.

Make sure to validate that Sales.PersonCreditCard and Sales.CreditCard exist in your AdventureWorks 2019 database and that the column names match those used in the script.
